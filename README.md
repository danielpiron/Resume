### Citigroup Derivatives Markets Incorporated (CDMI), Jersey City, NJ
**Technical Lead/Architect for SDLC Tools Development (VP)** ~ *2015-Present*
 * Redesigned and lead the Python rewrite of in-house polyglot dependency
   management and build system, maintaining significant backwards
   compatibility with legacy system setting the stage for a Perforce to
   Git transition.
 * Promoted the use of Test Driven Development during Python rewrite
   significantly facilitating the implementation of complex changes to
   the code base.
 * Lead effort to transition hundreds of developers from disparate teams
   and thousands of build artifacts from Perforce to Git.
 * Maintained an open and friendly work environment with offshore talent,
   fostering a culture of personal growth and satisfaction where said talent
   often feels motivated to exceed expectations.
 * Conducted a weekly series of hour long educational sessions to provide
   training and insight to our tools and build process increasing user
   competence and satisfaction.

### Citigroup Derivatives Markets Incorporated (CDMI), Jersey City, NJ
**Software Configuration Management** ~ *2005-2015*
 * Unified nearly a dozen disparate builds, making up over 700 build artifacts,
   into a single continuously integrated process through the development of a
   makefile-free, multi-platform (Win32, Linux 32/64) and multi-language (C++,
   Managed C++, CSharp, Java) automated system allowing anyone to add a new
   project to the build simply by checking in source and providing a list of
   required dependencies.
 * Automated in-house code generation routines and seamlessly integrated them
   into our code management system replacing manually run ad hoc scripts
   previously maintained by individual developers eliminating 95% of build
   errors due to code generation.
 * Implemented a simple dependency filtering mechanism that  resulted a 40%
   decrease in build times by better targeting artifacts by platform. Further
   gains in performance were made by reducing the number of calls to the SCM by
   60% in selected processes.
 * Designed and developed a process for source control configuration, based on
   concepts of inheritance, allowing for the automated propagation of production
   configs to over a dozen development and QA environments, reducing the config
   set needed to properly maintain an environment from thousands of files to
   under 20.
 * Created custom bindings between the Perforce source control management system
   and TeamTrack (and later JIRA) issue tracking system(s) allowing management
   to tightly control developer check-in increasing the reliability, fidelity and
   transparency of the development cycle.
 * Consistently called upon to troubleshoot issues in development, QA, and
   Production environments going above and beyond expected duties using various
   tools including code comparison, debuggers and dependency analyzers.
 * Was tasked with migrating and adapting QA and Development laboratories to
   Citigroup’s SOE environment.
 * Supported releases to operations facilities in North America, Europe, and
   Asia.
