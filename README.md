## Experience

### Citigroup Derivatives Markets Incorporated (CDMI), Jersey City, NJ
**ERA III - Application Monitoring and Test Utility Development and DevOps** ~ *2019-Present*
 * Developed test framework for high frequency trading application development.
   Framework allows users to specify database, market data, quant, and GUI user
   inputs via a custom scripting language along with assertions for matching
   expected application.
 * Created regression test application for detecting inconistencies in quant
   code between releases of the application by replaying trades and reliability
   reproducing curve movement.
 * Designed C++ wrapper to ITRS monitoring XMLRPC API reporting obscure
   performance statistics and better allocating resources in production system.
   Wrapper subsequently shared with other groups through out Citi to accelerate
   firm wide efforts to adopt ITRS as a monitoring tool.
 * Built a daily release impact report combining data from Jira, Bitbucket, and
   our custom build system indicating which Jiras targeting were missing pull
   requests provided tremendous transparency of the current state of the
   release for the Dev and QA teams.
 * Tied Jira workflow to Bitbucket pull request approval and merge process
   promoting a consistent flow and clean hand-off between Dev and QA that
   succinctly abided by audit requirements.
 * Collaborated closely with production staff creating a seamless process for
   transferring artifacts, documentation, database scripts, etc.
 * Managed Jira, Bitbucket, Jenkins, Teamcity, SonarCube instances that were
   part of the DevOps infrastructure.
 * Developed Docker based prototype build and runtime environments for
   application transitioning from Windows .NET to DotNET Core on Linux.
 * Adapted SonarCube reporting into custom builds workflow.

### Citigroup Derivatives Markets Incorporated (CDMI), Jersey City, NJ
**Technical Lead/Architect for SDLC Tools Development and DevOps** ~ *2015-2019*
 * Redesigned the Python rewrite of in-house multi-language (C++, C#, Java) and
   cross-platform (Windows & Linux) dependency management and build system,
   maintaining significant backwards compatibility with legacy system setting
   the stage for a Perforce to Git transition.
 * Lead effort to transition hundreds of developers from disparate teams
   and thousands of build artifacts from Perforce to Git.
 * Quality of architecture allowed transition between disparate artifact
   storage on Windows and Linux to Artifactory resulting in zero downtime for
   100s of users.
 * Conducted a weekly series of hour long educational sessions to provide
   training and insight to our tools and build process improving user
   competence and satisfaction.

### Citigroup Derivatives Markets Incorporated (CDMI), Jersey City, NJ
**Software Configuration Management** ~ *2005-2015*
 * Developed build and dependency management system (in Perl) unifying nearly a
   dozen disparate builds, making up over 700 build artifacts, into a single
   continuously integrated process through the development of a cross-platform
   (Win32, Linux 32/64) and multi-language (C++, Managed C++, CSharp, Java).
   Users could add a new project to the build simply by checking in source and
   providing a list of required dependencies. This also facilitated efforts to
   port applications from Windows to Linux. 
 * Automated in-house code generation routines and seamlessly integrated them
   into our code management system replacing manually run ad hoc scripts
   previously maintained by individual developers eliminating 99% of build
   errors due to code generation.
 * Designed and developed a process for automating propagation of production
   configuration files to over a dozen development and QA environments,
   reducing the configuration set needed to properly maintain an environment
   from thousands of files to under 20.
 * Created custom bindings between the Perforce source control management
   system and TeamTrack (and later JIRA) issue tracking system(s) allowing
   management to tightly control developer check-in increasing the reliability,
   fidelity and transparency of the development cycle.
 * Consistently called upon to troubleshoot issues in development, QA, and
   Production environments going above and beyond expected duties using various
   tools including code comparison, debuggers and dependency analyzers.
 * Was tasked with migrating and adapting QA and Development laboratories to
   Citigroup’s SOE environment.
 * Supported releases to operations facilities in North America, EMEA, and APAC
   regions.
