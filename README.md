## Experience

### Citigroup Derivatives Markets Incorporated (CDMI), Jersey City, NJ
**ERA III - Application Monitoring and Test Utility Development and DevOps** ~ *2015-Present*
 * Enhanced legacy trading application to allow it to run stand-alone (without
   a lab testing environment) by transparently mocking inputs requiring no
   modification to core components.
 * Created regression test application to detect inconistencies in quant code
   between releases of the application by replaying trades and reliability
   reproducing curve movement.
 * Designed C++ wrapper to ITRS monitoring XMLRPC API. This wrapper was
   subsequently used to report previously obscured performance statistics that
   were used to better allocate resources in production system. The wrapper was
   also shared with other groups through out Citi accelerating the efforts of
   other C++ based teams to adopt ITRS as their monitoring system.
 * Managed Jira, Bitbucket, Jenkins, Teamcity instances that were part of the
   DevOps infrastructure.

### Citigroup Derivatives Markets Incorporated (CDMI), Jersey City, NJ
**Technical Lead/Architect for SDLC Tools Development and DevOps** ~ *2015-2019*
 * Tied Jira workflow to Bitbucket pull request approval and merge process
   promoting a consistent flow for developers that succictly abided by all
   audit requirements.
 * Redesigned and lead the Python rewrite of in-house polyglot dependency
   management and build system, maintaining significant backwards
   compatibility with legacy system setting the stage for a Perforce to
   Git transition.
 * Promoted the use of Test Driven Development during Python rewrite
   significantly facilitating the implementation of complex changes to
   the code base.
 * Lead effort to transition hundreds of developers from disparate teams
   and thousands of build artifacts from Perforce to Git.
 * Maintained an open and friendly work environment with offshore talent,
   fostering a culture of personal growth and satisfaction where said talent
   often feels motivated to exceed expectations.
 * Conducted a weekly series of hour long educational sessions to provide
   training and insight to our tools and build process increasing user
   competence and satisfaction.

### Citigroup Derivatives Markets Incorporated (CDMI), Jersey City, NJ
**Software Configuration Management** ~ *2005-2015*
 * Unified nearly a dozen disparate builds, making up over 700 build artifacts,
   into a single continuously integrated process through the development of a
   makefile-free, multi-platform (Win32, Linux 32/64) and multi-language (C++,
   Managed C++, CSharp, Java) automated system allowing anyone to add a new
   project to the build simply by checking in source and providing a list of
   required dependencies.
 * Automated in-house code generation routines and seamlessly integrated them
   into our code management system replacing manually run ad hoc scripts
   previously maintained by individual developers eliminating 95% of build
   errors due to code generation.
 * Implemented a simple dependency filtering mechanism that  resulted a 40%
   decrease in build times by better targeting artifacts by platform. Further
   gains in performance were made by reducing the number of calls to the SCM by
   60% in selected processes.
 * Designed and developed a process for source control configuration, based on
   concepts of inheritance, allowing for the automated propagation of production
   configs to over a dozen development and QA environments, reducing the config
   set needed to properly maintain an environment from thousands of files to
   under 20.
 * Created custom bindings between the Perforce source control management system
   and TeamTrack (and later JIRA) issue tracking system(s) allowing management
   to tightly control developer check-in increasing the reliability, fidelity and
   transparency of the development cycle.
 * Consistently called upon to troubleshoot issues in development, QA, and
   Production environments going above and beyond expected duties using various
   tools including code comparison, debuggers and dependency analyzers.
 * Was tasked with migrating and adapting QA and Development laboratories to
   Citigroup’s SOE environment.
